== Command-Line Tools

=== powershell.exe

menu:Start[Windows PowerShell > Windows PowerShell] +
menu:Start[Run] -> 'powershell' -> btn:[Run]

`C:\Windows\System32\PowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` +
`C:\Windows\SysWOW64\PowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`

=== Important Options

`-` _or_ `/` can be used for option switches.

`-ExecutionPolicy`:: Allows you to set the process ExecutionPolicy for the process call.
`-File`:: Sources the script file at the path.
`-Command`:: Executes a command before any other actions.
`-NoProfile`:: Does not load any user profiles during the process execution.
`-Help`:: Gets you better definitions then mine. 

**Example:** + 
`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -File build.ps1`

=== csc.exe

`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\<version>\csc.exe` +
`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\<version>\csc.exe`

=== Important Options

_`csc.exe` takes the input files as the arguments..._ +
`-` _or_ `/` can be used for option switches.

`/target:library`:: Build a library. Use `exe` for a console exectuable.
`/doc:<file>`:: Documentation file built from comments.
`/reference:<file list>`:: Add references from specified assemblies to use in compilation.
`/debug[+/-]`:: Emit dubugging information.

=== Important Options

`/optimize[+/-]`:: Enable optimization for the detected or specified platform.
`/checked[+/-]`:: Overflow checks.
`/define:<symbol list>`:: "Preprocessor" defintions here.
`/out:<file>`:: Specify the output file and path.
`/help`:: Again, better help than I just gave.

**Example:** + 
`csc.exe /t:library /r:../projectA/assemblies/reference.dll /checked+ /d:RECURSE /o+ /out:something.dll`

== Understanding .NET

The .NET Framework is designed to fulfill the following objectives: 

* To provide a consistent object-oriented programming environment 
* To provide a code-execution environment that minimizes software deployment and versioning conflicts 
* To provide a code-execution environment that promotes safe execution of code 
* To provide a code-execution environment that eliminates the performance problems of scripted or interpreted environments 
* To make the developer experience consistent across widely varying types of apps 
* To build all communication on industry standards to ensure that code based on the .NET Framework integrates with any other code

=== Version Hell

CLR Version:: The runtime version supported.
Framework Version:: The Framework version. Typically indicates the CLR version and what libraries are included.
Compiler/Interpreter Version:: The actual software version of the compiler. The compiler can only operate with certain Framework versions and can only compile certain language versions. 
<Language> Version:: The version of the syntax supported. You may write valid C# 7.0 code, but if you don't have the most recent compiler, you will not be able to compile the code. You may write valid PowerShell 5.0 code, but an older interpreter may not be able to compile it.

=== What should you be working with?

Windows 10 defaults:

[none]
* CLR 4
* Framework 4.7+
* CSC 4.8.3752.0 
* C# 5
* PowerShell 5.1

== Process or Host?

== PowerShell Execution Policy

"Windows PowerShell execution policies let you determine the conditions under which Windows PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts. The execution policy is not a security system that restricts user actions. For example, users can easily circumvent a policy by typing the script contents at the command line when they cannot run a script. Instead, the execution policy helps users to set basic rules and prevents them from violating them unintentionally."
-- Microsoft, about_Execution_Policies

=== A Rundown

Precedence (Highest to Lowest)

[none]
* **MachinePolicy**
* **UserPolicy**
* Process (or powershell/pwsh.exe -ExecutionPolicy)
* CurrentUser
* **LocalMachine**

=== !

image::powerShellExecutionPolicy.png[role="center"]

=== What's this mean? 

Add to your profile: 

`Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser`

Or whenever you spool a process:

`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`

=== Important

A child process (process spawned from another) will inherit the ExecutionPolicy of its parent!

== Syntax 

You ever use C/{cpp} or Java?

=== Hello World!

[source,c#]
----
using System;

class Hello
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
----

=== !

"C# programs can consist of one or more files. Each file can contain zero or more namespaces. A namespace can contain types such as classes, structs, interfaces, enumerations, and delegates, in addition to other namespaces."
-- Microsoft, C# Docs

=== !

[source,c#]
----
// Because the compiler easily accepts many files, these usually go into their own file across a shared namespace
namespace YourNamespace
{
    using System;
    
    class YourClass
    {
    }

    struct YourStruct
    {
    }

    interface IYourInterface 
    {
    }

    delegate int YourDelegate();

    enum YourEnum 
    {
        Option1,
        Option2
    }

    namespace YourNestedNamespace
    {
        // this is pretty frowned upon

        struct YourStruct 
        {
        }
    }

    class YourMainClass
    {
        static void Main(string[] args) 
        {
            //Your program starts here...
        }
    }
} 
----

=== Types and Variables

* Value
** Simple Types
*** Signed Integral: `sbyte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
*** Unsigned Integral: `byte`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong` 
*** Unicode Characters: `char`
*** IEEE Floats: `float`, `double`
*** High precision: `decimal`
*** Booleans: `bool`
** Enum 
** Struct
** Nullables

=== Types and Variables

* Reference
** Classes 
*** base is `object` 
*** Unicode strings: `string`
*** User defined types
** Interfaces
** Arrays
** Delegates (and Actions)

=== Expressions

Operands + Operator = Expressions

[source,c#]
----
var n = x + y * z; 
var b = x > y ? true : false; 
var maybe = x ?? y;
----

All expression are _left-associative_ except for the null-coalessing operators `??` and `??=`

=== Statements

Mostly standard with a few extras. Here's a list:

[none]
* `const`
* `if-else`
* `switch`
* `while`
* `do`
* `for`
* `foreach`
* `break`
* `continue`
* `goto`
* `return`
* `yield`

=== Statements

* `throw`
* `try-catch[-finally]`
* `using`
* `checked` / `unchecked`
* `lock`

== PowerShell Syntax

PowerShell is _really a fancy wrapper_ for C#.

That's why I call it _C# Lite_.

=== Hello World!

[source, powershell]
----
'Hello World!'

# Or explicitly
Write-Output 'Hello World!'

# Or closer to the curtain...
[Console]::WriteLine('Hello World!');
----

=== !

Understand PowerShell is:

[none]
* Object-Oriented and output is object-based
* The command family is extensible 
* As a scripting language it is imperative and executes from first line to last line

=== ! 

Cmdlets:

* Cmdlets use verb-noun names to reduce command memorization
* Cmdlets use standard parameters

=== ! 

There is no standard script and no boilerplate necessary! 

Script to your hearts desire!

"I can show you the world"
-- Aladdin

=== Expressions

_Everything is an expression!_

This is great because it means you can assign the result of any code block to variable!

[source,powershell]
----
$canProcess = 
    if ($isTrue) {
        $true
    }
    else {
        $false
    }
----

=== Keywords

Since PowerShell isn't statement based, it relies on keywords to control flow. These keywords are parsed, so their syntax and structure is important.

[none]
* `begin`
* `break`
* `class`
* `continue`
* `data`
* `do-while`
* `do-until`
* `dynamicParam`
* `end`
* `enum`

=== Keywords

* `exit`
* `filter`
* `for`
* `foreach`
* `function`
* `hidden`
* `if-elseif-else`
* `in`
* `param`
* `process`
* `return`

=== Keywords

* `static`
* `switch`
* `throw`
* `try-catch[-finally]`
* `using`
* `while`

=== Operators

Arithmetic::
    `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `%`, including unary operators
Assignment:: 
    `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
Comparison::
    `-eq`, `-ne`, `-gt`, `-lt`, `-ge`, `-le`,
Logical::
    `-and`, `-or`, `-xor`, `-not`, `!`

=== Operators

Redirection::
    `>>`, `>`, `2>&1`... 
Array/String::
    `-split`, `-join`
Type::
    `-is`, `-isnot`, `-as`

=== Special Operators

Array Sub-Expression::
    `@()`, returns the expression as an array even if only has one member.
Hashtable Sub-Expression::  
    `@{}`, returns the scriptblock as a hashtable.
Array::
    `,` as a binary operator, creates an array. As a unary operator creates an array with one member.
Sourcing::
    `.`, elevates the object into the parent scope.

=== Special Operators

Call::
    `&`, executes the object as a block of code in seperate scope, returning the result.
Cast::
    `[]`, Converts or limits objects to the specified type. If the objects cannot be converted, PowerShell generates an error.
Index::
    `[]`, Selects objects from indexed collections.
Pipeline:: 
    `|`, When the output includes more than one object, the pipeline operator sends the objects one at a time.

=== Special Operators 

Member Access::
    `.`, Accesses the properties and methods of an object.
Range::
    `..`, Creates an integer sequence with an upper and lower bound.
Static Member Access::
    `::`, Used in combination with a casted type to access static members and methods of a .NET type.
Subexpression:: 
    `$()`, Returns the result of one or more statements, executed in a child scope. 

=== Functions

[source,powershell]
----
function Get-Sum {
    param([Parameter(ValueFromPipeline)] [int] $Number)

    begin {
        $acc = 0 
    }
    process {
        $acc += $Number 
    }
    end {
        $acc
    } 
}
----

=== Advanced

Developers cried for access to underlying `PSObjects`. As of PowerShell 5.0, Microsoft complied, allowing...

[source,powershell]
----
enum {
    Option1,
    Option2
}

class MyClass {
    hidden [int] $Secret = 42
    static [MyClass[]] $Display = @()
    [string] $Name

    MyClass([string] $s) {
        $this.Name = $s

        [MyClass]::Display += $this
    }

    static [void] WriteThings() {
        foreach ($thing in [MyClass]::Display) {
            Write-Warning ("This thing exists: " + ($thing.Name)) 
        } 
    } 
}
----

=== Differences

[source,powershell]
----
if ($isThing) {
    Invoke-Something 
}
elseif ($isSomething) {
    Invoke-SomethingElse
}
else {
    # Forget it
    Exit-Process
}
----

[source,powershell]
----
$x = 1, 2, 78, 0

do {
    $count++
    $a++
} until ($x[$a] -eq 0) 
----

== Demo

== Building without MSBuild or Visual Studio!?

Have you heard of `make`, `cmake`, `rake`?

C# has `cake`. F# has `fake`.

PowerShell has:

* `psake`
* `invoke-build`
* custom solutions galore!

== Upgrading

* Visual Studio
* Visual Studio Code + .NET Core SDK

== Questions?
