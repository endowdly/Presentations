== Why am I doing this to you?

Who here has to work with a lot of data?

[.notes]
-- 
* big data processing convo with talbert and barker
* f#
* dev environment

== What is PowerShell

image::powershell.png[ps_logo, 200, 200, role="center"]

* Task automation framework that is primarily a command-line shell and scripting language
* Designed by Microsoft in late 2006
* Now open-source and cross plaform, it runs on .NET Framework and .NET Core

[.notes]
--
* latest 6.1.1, released late 2018
* Microsoft's primary scripting framework
* Precursor is Monad
--

== Command Line Shell

* It does everything `bash` and `cmd.exe` do but _more_ and _better_
* Process objects not strings!
* Can execute many commands
* Built-in customizable tab completion
* Robust aliasing
* Named and positional parameters, with support for dynamic parameters
* Very powerful formatting control of data types and host output
* Modular through modules and providers

[.notes]
--
* commands
** cmdlets (.NET programs that link compiled libraries to the command line)
** scripts
** functions
** aliases
** executables to include: .bat, .cmd, .com, .cpl, standalone scripts...
* modules are collections of scripts
* providers are data stores like file system and registry

== Shell Demo

image::posh_shell.gif[role="center"]

== Scripting Language

* C# Lite with a hint of Perl and Ksh
* Interpreted
* Support asyncronous and parallel operations
* Primary paradigm is imperative and object-oriented
* Supports reflective, functional, and pipelined paradigms
* Safely, strongly, and outwardly dynamically typed (it's really static)
* Danger: Dynamic scoping!

== Script Snippets

image::script_snip.png[role="center"]

== Task Automation and Configuration

* Full access to .NET
* Full access to COM and WMI (on Windows machines)
* Some access to WS-Management and CIM (Unix)
* Desired State Configuration built-in! 
* Provides hosting API for embedding into other apps (like Microsoft SQL Server)
* Background Jobs
* Scheduled Jobs
* Easy Event Handling
* Remoting
* Strong Security Features

[.notes]
--
This means it can be a decent automated lab bench testing controller
--

== What is C#

image::csharp.png[csharp_logo, 200, 200, role="center"]

* General-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language that is strongly typed and cross platform
* Designed by Microsoft, released in 2000, it's now a backbone of Windows
* Now open-source and cross plaform, it runs on .NET Framework and .NET Core

[.notes]
--
* It is primarily imperative and object-oriented
* Last release was version 7.3 in May 2018
* C# 8 is in the works -- preview 5 available now
* C# is standardized (ECMA & ISO) and many some of its compilers are open-source
* But, newer versions are focusing on declarative, functional, and generic programming
* First released in 2000
--

== What is it good at?

* Rapid production and productivity
* Native Desktop Application and GUIs
* Parallel operations
* Portability
* Games (Unity & Godot)
* *Simulation & Modeling*
* ...and it's good at PowerShell Cmdlets

== Productivity?

* Native garbage collection
* Meta-programming
* True generics
* Huge standard library
* Allows for native and managed code 
* Highly integrated
* Composable & Modular
* Pretty! 

== How do we get these cool toys?

[.step]
* They are already on your computer!


== Windows 10

Ships with 32bit and 64bit versions of: 

* powershell.exe
* powershell_ise.exe
* csc.exe 

== Other

++.++NET Core has 64bit versions of:

* pwsh.exe
* dotnet.exe (Rosyln compiler)

== Other C# compilers

* Mono 
* Xamarin

== When and Where can I use them? 

[.step]
* PowerShell and C# are essential parts to the Windows ecosystem, and are available always, anytime. 
* They are also available on major Linux distributions and to OS X through the .NET Core SDK.

== PowerShell

menu:Start[Windows PowerShell > Windows PowerShell] +
menu:Start[Run] -> 'powershell' -> btn:[Run]

`C:\Windows\System32\PowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` +
`C:\Windows\SysWOW64\PowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`

== Csc

`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\<version>\csc.exe` +
`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\<version>\csc.exe`

== Why is this important

1. Analysis of large data sets with complex queries can take a long time
2. Simulating and modeling complex scenarios can be hard to design and execute

Getting specialized software and coding frameworks to alleviate those issues can be problematic:
[.step]
* Overarching regulations and policies
* Licensing and costs
* IT bottlenecks
* PowerShell and C# are solutions!

== Analysis and Data Modeling

PowerShell is good for small, quick inspection

* Natively load CSV, JSON, string data, and PowerShell Data files as objects
* Modules exist for other formats
* Objects are easy to inspection

== Inspection Example

image::data_crunch.gif[role="center"]

== C# is good for everything else

* Natively supports many data formats
* Parsers are easy to build or implement
* LINQ allows for side-effect free queries and functions
* Steppability using `yield` allows for complex query control
* Robust data and statistics libraries available
* Easy to implement custom libraries
* Getting easier to use with every version update

== Linq Example

image::linq.png[linq, 800]

== HMM Example

image::hmm.png[hmm, 800]

Using the Accord.NET ML library... 

== Map Reduce

Using only a few key C# components, parallel map reduction can be preformed with minimal effort when compared to creating parallel map reduction processes in other languages. 

image::mr.png[mapReduce, 800]

== Simulation

* Monte Carlo Simulation
* Wave Simulation
* Particle Simulation
* Discrete Event Simulation (Growth)
* Gravity Simulation
* Doppler Simulations

Easy to incorporate results to visuals or graphics!

== Simulation Example

What can we do with both? 

== Compilation without MSBuild or Visual Studio

== Advantages 

* Native support
* Compiled and optimized
* GUI building is easy!
* Productive! 
* Familiar but better (C++)

== Versus Python

* Zoom! JIT not part of it
* IronPython still isn't as integrated and not updated
* Python does not include batteries
* No installation

== Versus MATLAB

* Zoom!!!! 
* Free
* No installation
* Not as obscure

== Versus Java 

* Generics
* Anonymous Functions
* Delgates
* Lambdas
* No installation (JRE no JDK) 

== Disadvantages

* Plotting options are anemic 
* Out of the box numerical libraries are weak (but improving)
* Not as fast as C or C++

== Tools

* PowerShell ISE
* Notepad ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
* Visual Studio Code
* Visual Studio 2017 Community 
* dotnet
* nuget

== A Quick Note on F#

* F# is C# more purely functional brother
* Much friendlier towards math and data science
* Much easier to use numerical and machine learning libraries
* But needs Visual Studio or the .NET Core SDK
